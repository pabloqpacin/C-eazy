<summary>[solved] Compiler error with <\math.h></summary>

1. problem
```bash
[Running] cd "/home/pabloqpacin/ASIR+/C-eazy/2-Variables/" && gcc practicals2-9.c -o practicals2-9 && "/home/pabloqpacin/ASIR+/C-eazy/2-Variables/"practicals2-9
/usr/bin/ld: /tmp/ccM2AvDd.o: in function `main':
practicals2-9.c:(.text+0x134): undefined reference to `sqrt'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```

   3. [documentation3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57173093/how-to-include-compiler-flags-in-visual-studio-code)

3. solution: add `-lm` to CLI command or VSCode's `tasks.json`!

```bash
# Add -lm to gcc command
gcc foo.c -o foo -lm
```

```json
// .vscode/tasks.json
{
    "tasks": [
        {
            "args": [
                "-lm"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
